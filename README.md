# SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transfer)
This code is an implementation for Anatomy of the SIFT method paper (IPOL Journal)
You can find the paper at http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2014/82/
This paper is so well written
Read the paper for detailed expalanation 
I did my best to follow the precedure mentioned in the main paper
There is a c++ implementation by the authers you can find on the link above
Here you can find the Python and Matlab source code 
There are probably parts inefficiently implemented but you can use it for for educational purpose
Note that python numpy arrays are slower comparison to arrays in c++ and Matrix objecta in Matlab
