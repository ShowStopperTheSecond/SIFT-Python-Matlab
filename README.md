# SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transfer) 
This code is an implementation for Anatomy of the SIFT method paper (IPOL Journal) <br>
You can find the paper at http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2014/82/<br>
This paper is so well written read the paper for detailed expalanation <br>
I did my best to follow the precedure mentioned in the main paper<br>
There is a c++ implementation by the authers you can find on the link above<br>
Here you can find the Python and Matlab source code <br>
There are probably parts inefficiently implemented but you can use it for for educational purpose<br>
Note that python numpy arrays are slower comparison to arrays in c++ and Matrix objecta in Matlab<br>
Run the ipython file for camparing this implementation and the one by the authers<br>
